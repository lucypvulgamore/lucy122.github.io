    <p class="maintext">Throughout the early stages of the Coronavirus pandemic within the United States and across the whole globe, the CDC urged elderly populations to remain extra cautious against the disease; making sure to mask up and getting frequent testing done, for example; due to research showing that the disease has symptoms evidenced to be significantly more impactful towards the elderly. <br> What about those in the elderly stage who require external care, however? Open-source data from <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/">New York State Open Health Data</a>  shows just how nursing homes and care facilities in the Central New York area managed their residents and care quality throughout the pandemic. The chart on the right displays the number of weeks in which at least one COVID-19 related death was reported within a care facility classified within the Central New York Regional Office between May 2020 and November 2022. Through looking at this data, it is evident that the observed facilities within the Onondaga, Oneida, and Broome Counties have had the least success across all observed CNY counties in keeping COVID-19 deaths in control. In reasoning that may be deeper than simple coincidence, areas within these three countries were also considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/world/covid-hot-spot-new-york-counties.html/">hot spots</a> for COVID-19  infection rates. The New York Times attributed these rates to high travel volumes due to the location of two college campuses Syracuse University and State University of New York in Binghamton; in Onondaga County and Broome County, respectively.

<p class="maintext">It is no secret that nursing homes and care facilities in Central New York areas are in need of improved attention. A recent study from the American Association of Retired Persons found that <a href="https://aarp-states.brightspotcdn.com/cf/44/882451474420b59c3588c386bec4/failing-nys-nursing-home-residents.pdf">68% of these facilities did not receive a visit from an oversight program</a> in the first three months of 2022.  Vicky Simpson, a financial healthcare coordinator specializing in geriatric care from the northeast era urges that this observed lack of surveillance from oversight programs is a large contributor to the declining quality of care within these facilities. Furthermore, she believes a primary factor of these death rates to be due to a severe staffing shortage within these facilities, making necessity services for residents such as showers more inaccessible than is sustainable. The industry overall, she emphasizes, needs to pay caregivers more in order to provide ample support towards the caregiversâ€™ ability to provide exemplary care, in addition to listening to the needs of caregivers that are made evident in times like the pandemic.
  <br> <br>
Delving further into the displayed data, it is apparent that the lower the population of a county, the lower the number of weeks marked by at least one death. Lewis County, NY, for example, has the lowest number of weeks (only nine), and the lowest population (<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lewiscountynewyork/PST045221">26,573</a>) out of each recorded county to boot. Similarly, Onondaga County, NY, has the highest number of weeks with recorded deaths (a whopping 318), and the largest population (<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/onondagacountynewyork">473,236</a>) out of each recorded county. Although there are a varying number of aspects that may contribute to infection  and death levels across Central NY counties, the data clearly evidences a possible correlation between population volume and infection- as urged by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html">CDC Guidelines</a> throughout 2020.

       <p class="maintext">The chart displayed towards the left shows how COVID-19 related deaths within nursing homes and care facilities in Onondaga County alone fluctuated over time, from May 2020 to November 2022. Upon analyzing the data, it is no surprise that the peak of deaths related to COVID-19 within nursing homes occurred towards the end of 2020- with a drastic spike from 6 deaths in November to a jarring 107 deaths that following December. Beyond that time frame, the number of recorded deaths follows a more steady guideline as the severity of the pandemic decreased further and further between mid-2021 and 2022. Within those two years, the largest spike seen was observed in January 2021 with 15 deaths, and could likely be attributed to the return of out-of-state Syracuse students from winter break, as predicted by the New York Times.</p>
